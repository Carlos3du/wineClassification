# Wine Classification
This project focuses on building and study machine learning models to classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties and analyse and compare the results of each operations with different metrics. 

## Overview
The goal of this project is to classify wines into categories using supervised and non-supervised learning techniques. The project explores data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains chemical analysis results of wines. It includes features such as alcohol content, acidity, and more. Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the code.
